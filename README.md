# Errgent - Grammatical Error Generation Toolkit ü§ñ

![maven](https://github.com/manzurola/errgent/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

Errgent generates grammatically incorrect variances of a valid English sentence.

## How It Works

We first create variances of the document by inflecting each token in the document. For English, we use SimpleNLG to create inflections in a brute force manner. 

We then process each inflected doc by Errant, which annotates each doc pair (inflected vs original) for grammatical errors.

Finally, we filter each pair to match those which contain the specified grammatical error. 

## Prerequisits

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have Java 11 installed.
* You have access to Github Packages Maven registry as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).
* You have the necessary prerequisites for [Errant4J](https://github.com/manzurola/errant4j#prerequisits).

## Installing Errgent

Add this to the dependencies section of your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.manzurola</groupId>
  <artifactId>errgent</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Using Errgent

To use Errgent in code, follow these steps:

```java
// Create a spacy instance (from spaCy4j)
SpaCy spacy = SpaCy.create(CoreNLPAdapter.forEnglish());

// Instantiate a new Errgent for English
Generator errgent = Errgent.forEnglish(spacy);

// Generate a specific grammatical error in the target doc. Since a
// sentence can contain multiple errors at once, all such possible
// errors are returned.
List<GeneratedError> generatedErrors = errgent.generateErrors(
    "If I were you, I would go home.",
    GrammaticalError.REPLACEMENT_SUBJECT_VERB_AGREEMENT
);

// Print out the results. The markedText() method retrieves the
// erroneous text with the error marked by an asterisk on both sides.
// We can also access the char offsets of the error using charStart
// and charEnd methods of GeneratedError.
for (GeneratedError generatedError : generatedErrors) {
    String text = generatedError.markedText();
    System.out.printf(
        "%s, %s%n",
        text,
        generatedError.error()
    );
}
```

Errgent is currently available only for English.
